Hi! I'm Emily. Welcome to my GitHub page. 

**About Me**

I am an emerging Front End Developer passionate about building engaging user experiences. As a career-changer, my coding skills partner well with my transferrable skills from a dynamic career in food & hospitality. Whether designing and building a 5-page small business website or catering an event for 500 people, I love the process of envisioning, planning, collaborating and executing end-results that exceed client expectations and deliver memorable experiences for visitors and guests. I am excited to put all this energy and enthusiasm into an early-career Front End Developer position at a diverse and inclusive company that supports and encourages continued learning and development.
